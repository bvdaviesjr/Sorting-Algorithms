Quick Sort – A sorting technique that sequences a list by continuously dividing the list into two parts and moving the lower items to one side and the higher items to the other. It starts by picking one item in the entire list to serve as a pivot point. The pivot could be the first item or a randomly chosen one. All items that compare lower than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot; all equal or higher items are moved to the right. It then picks a pivot for the left side and moves those items to left and right of the pivot and continues the pivot picking and dividing until there is only one item left in the group. It then proceeds to the right side and performs the same operation again.

Example (Concrete) – Quick Sort
	var items = [100, -1, -100, 20, 10, 13, 11, 67, 54, 88, 73, 99, 89, 100, 80]; 

// This function will be used to arrange 1 element in its correct position at every iteration of the complete implementation of the function
function pivot(arr, start=0, end=arr.length+1){
// This function will be used to swap elements - interchangably
  function swap(array, i, j) {
    var temp = array[i];
    array[i] = array[j];
    array[j] = temp;
  }

  var pivot = arr[start];
  var swapIdx = start;
  
// This loop will be used to find every element that is smaller than the pivot and swap it
  for(var i = start + 1; i < arr.length; i++){
    if(pivot > arr[i]){
      swapIdx++;
      swap(arr,swapIdx,i);
    }
  }
// This code will swap the current pivot element with the element with the last swap index
  swap(arr,start,swapIdx);
  return swapIdx;
}

// This function will a complete array into 2 as long as the beginning-index of the array is less the end-index of the array. When they are equal, the condition fails
function quickSort(arr, left = 0, right = arr.length -1){
    if(left < right){
 // This code will find the initial index of the full array – it will run only once
 let pivotIndex = pivot(arr, left, right) //3
        //This code will run on the left array
        quickSort(arr,left,pivotIndex-1);
        //This code will run on the right array
        quickSort(arr,pivotIndex+1,right);
      }
     return arr;
} 
 // This code will run the function          
console.log(quickSort([100,-3,2,4,6,9,1,2,5,3,23]))
